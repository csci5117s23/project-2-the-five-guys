Our homepage will show the user all national parks either in a list view or a map view. The user can toggle between these easily at the top of the page. Upon clicking on any of the parks, it will bring you to the park's page, which will show a zoomed in map of the area and information regarding the area. Clicking on the My Trips button at the bottom of the screen brings you to a page displaying past and future trips to different national parks. Of course, this requires a login capability, which we will add. Each past and future trip can be viewed, showing pictures and notes from that trip. The log and plan trip pages allow the user to log past trips and plan future trips using information grabbed from the National Parks API.
